## Getting Started
The Appâ€™s landing page consists of two login options. A user login and an admin login. 

After a succesful login, it shows a home page consisting a list of books with their details with a drawer.

### Login by user:-
User can login via their google account. 

User can issue/return books by a simple checkbox.

### Login by admin
Login Credentials:- username = SUTT_admin , password = 1234567890  (Login through Postman API)

Admin is logged in via an post api method and signed into the firebase anonymously.

Admin has the power to add books. This service can be accesed by the drawer.

He/She can also update the details of the book by clicking the book tile. A bottom sheet appears for this.

### Features:-
